**My vision of things**

This resource lets you open a door. You have to adapt it, or improve it as you see fit. The fact that I that it is not "more" complete is wanted. Many people already have their systems installed. In spite of this this resource will be adapted for the others that I would put online.


**How to install**

- Download resources on github
- Add it to the resources folder
- Add '- menuint' to AutoStartResources in citmp-server.yml
- Adapt the script to your resources (Request(s), Delete Function(s)?)
- Watch the events and use as you see fit
- Its goooooooood

**How to use**

- Press B for open menu, if you are close to a player the menu will open, otherwise a notification will be displayed. If more than one person is within the defined perimeter, the nearest one will be used.
- Controls : Arrows = Up, Down, Right, Left for navigate, Entrer for validate and Backspace for back

**Menu Interaction features**

- All of the following actions allow you to do an action to the nearest player within a given perimeter
- Giving cash / dirty cash
- Transfer bank
- Present your ID Card
- Police Menu : Put a fine, Inspect the player

_I could continue to make a more complete interaction menu but it's up to you to do it because each server is different I give you the tools to do it :)_

_**What is LVOS?**_

_This is the diminutive of Los Vanilla Open Source, it is simply the category where I would share the codes of the server Los Vanilla, my server. I will share server codes. Just a kind of signature :)_
